## Project Summary

`favorite-places` is a static-first Astro site that turns personal Google Maps saved lists into cleaner shareable guides.

- Frontend: Astro + TypeScript
- Data pipeline: Python + `uv`
- Source scraper: vendored git subtree at `vendor/gmaps-scraper/` from `https://github.com/508-dev/gmaps-scraper`
- Hosting target: static deploys on Cloudflare Pages or GitHub Pages

## Working Rules

- Prefer `rg` for search.
- Keep the root [`.python-version`](.python-version) aligned with `pyproject.toml` because Cloudflare Pages otherwise falls back to its default Python runtime.
- For Cloudflare Pages deploys, set `SKIP_DEPENDENCY_INSTALL=true` and `BUN_VERSION=1.3.12`, then use a custom build command that runs `bun ci`, installs `uv==0.11.6`, runs `uv sync`, then `bun run build:data` before `bun run build`.
- Use `uv sync` for Python dependencies.
- Use `bun install` for frontend dependencies.
- Use `bun run check` and `bun run build` before closing out frontend changes.
- Use `.venv/bin/python` if `uv run` hits sandbox cache issues in Codex.

## Self-Hosted Refresh Runner

The `data-refresh` workflow is intentionally tied to a self-hosted Linux runner. Treat the runner image or host provisioning as the contract for OS-level tools and browser libraries; do not install them ad hoc inside the workflow.

- `unzip` must be present on `PATH` because `oven-sh/setup-bun` downloads a `.zip` release archive.
- `cloakbrowser` downloads its own Chromium binary, but the host still needs Playwright/Chromium system libraries installed.
- Provision the runner with the equivalent of Playwright's Chromium Linux dependencies, for example the packages behind `playwright install-deps chromium`, instead of trying to `apt install` during the workflow run.
- The workflow includes a preflight check for `unzip` and a small set of required shared libraries (`libnspr4`, `libnss3`, GTK, GBM, X11, and related browser deps) so runner drift fails fast with a clear error.
- For Ubuntu-based runners, the concrete package fix for the current preflight is `sudo apt-get install -y libnspr4 libnss3 libgbm1 libxcb1 libxkbcommon0`, then `sudo ldconfig`. Verify with `ldconfig -p | grep -E 'libnspr4\.so|libnss3\.so|libgbm\.so\.1|libxcb\.so\.1|libxkbcommon\.so\.0'`. Prefer baking the full Playwright Chromium dependency set into the runner image with `sudo npx playwright install-deps chromium`.
- Set the repo Actions secret `GH_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` to a token with the minimum permissions needed for this automation: `workflows: write` to update refs that include `.github/workflows/**`, `contents: write` to push `automation/data-refresh`, and `pull-requests: write` to create or update the refresh PR. For a classic PAT, include the `workflow` scope in addition to normal `repo` write access. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot reliably create or advance `automation/data-refresh` after `.github/workflows/**` changes.

## Environment Variables

- `GOOGLE_MAPS_JS_API_KEY` is read by Astro during render/build and emitted into the page only when the Google map provider is active. Treat it as the browser Google Maps display key: production usage should be on a separate key restricted by HTTP referrer and limited to `Maps JavaScript API`.
- `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` is the optional server/build-time fallback key for Places enrichment when Google Maps place-page scraping cannot recover enough data. Do not expose it to the browser.
- `PUBLIC_MAP_PROVIDER=leaflet` forces the Leaflet/OpenStreetMap fallback even when `GOOGLE_MAPS_JS_API_KEY` is present.
- `GMAPS_SCRAPER_PROXY` optionally routes scraper traffic through a proxy. The pipeline keeps proxy-specific scraper sessions under `.context/gmaps-scraper/` and rotates them when they go stale or get blocked.
- `FAVORITE_PLACES_SITE_DIR` points both Astro and the Python data pipeline at the site pack. It defaults to `./site`, with `./site.example` as the fresh-checkout fallback.

## Data Practices

This repo deliberately avoids committing generated build artifacts.

- `site/data/raw/` may be committed when you want reproducible scraped snapshots in git.
- `site/data/cache/places.sqlite` is the canonical enrichment cache artifact when you want reproducible enrichment snapshots in git.
- `src/data/generated/` is local-only generated site input data.
- `public/data/search-index.json` is local-only generated browser search data.
- `site/overrides/` is the source-controlled layer for handwritten curation.
- `site/list_sources.json` is safe to commit if it only contains public list URLs you are comfortable sharing.
- In `site/list_sources.json`, `slug` is required. `type` is inferred for supported Google Maps `url` sources and local CSV `path` sources; explicit `type` is allowed but must match the configured `url` or `path`. Google My Maps URLs are not supported yet. `google_export_csv` sources still require `title`; `title` is optional for Google Maps URL sources as a fallback if the source data cannot recover the real title.

Merge precedence:

1. Manual overrides
2. Google Places enrichment cache
3. Raw scraped list data

## Common Commands

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
bun install
```

Populate local raw data from public Google Maps lists:

```bash
bun run sync:sources
```

This refreshes every configured source and then rebuilds generated site data. URL sources skip network refreshes until their `refresh_after` window expires unless the source config changes; CSV sources skip rewrites when their input hash is unchanged.

Force-refresh all configured raw source imports:

```bash
bun run sync:sources:force
```

Refresh one configured raw source by slug, source URL, or source path:

```bash
bun run sync:source -- tokyo-japan
```

Build generated JSON and search index data from local raw data:

```bash
bun run build:data
```

Use this when raw snapshots are already current and you only need to regenerate site inputs.
Configured local CSV sources are auto-imported into `site/data/raw/<slug>.json` before rebuild. Public URL sources are not refreshed here.

Fill or refresh Google Places enrichment cache:

```bash
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=... bun run enrich:data
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=... bun run fill:gaps
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=... bun run refresh:enrichment
```

Optional debug export of per-guide cache JSON from SQLite:

```bash
bun run export:cache:json
```

Run the site:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Guide pages default to Google Maps when `GOOGLE_MAPS_JS_API_KEY` is present at build/render time. Without that key, or when `PUBLIC_MAP_PROVIDER=leaflet`, they fall back to Leaflet.

## Notes For Future Agents

- Cloudflare Pages should not use its default `pip install .` auto-detection for this repo; the data pipeline depends on `uv` to resolve the vendored scraper from `vendor/gmaps-scraper`.
- Raw place `note` should flow through as the default place note.
- Raw place `is_favorite` should flow through as the default top-pick signal.
- Manual `note` and `top_pick` overrides still win.
- Manual `vibe_tags` overrides win over rule-derived browser search vibe tags.
- Place enrichment cache entries now carry `input_signature` and `refresh_after`; invalidation is not a single global TTL anymore.
- Raw saved-list snapshots now carry `fetched_at`, `refresh_after`, and `source_signature`; URL sources skip network refreshes until the refresh window expires unless the source config changes, while CSV sources can skip rewrites when the input hash is unchanged.
- The raw-list scraper now uses `gmaps-scraper`, which defaults to `curl_cffi` with browser fallback and supports place-page scraping. The pipeline reuses repo-local scraper sessions, rotates to a fresh identity when `GMAPS_SCRAPER_PROXY` changes, clears sessions after obvious block/cookie-jar failures, and expires idle sessions after 14 days.
- Enrichment now prefers `gmaps-scraper` place-page scraping and uses `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` only as a fallback when a place page is blocked, limited, or too thin to trust.
- Do not reintroduce tracked generated JSON unless the user explicitly asks for fixture-style examples in git.
